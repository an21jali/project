Introduction to Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App, a tool provided by Facebook.

Scripts Available
Once you have cloned the project, navigate to its directory and utilize the following commands:

npm start
This command runs the application in development mode. You can view it at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The page will automatically reload upon any code changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the test documentation for further details.

npm run build
This command builds the application for production in the build folder. It bundles React in production mode, optimizing for the best performance. The build output is minified and includes hashed filenames, making it deployable.

For more details on deployment, visit deployment documentation.

npm run eject
Note: This action is irreversible.

If you wish to customize the build tool and configurations beyond the provided features, ejecting the application allows full control over dependencies such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

Explore additional configuration options in the advanced configuration documentation.
